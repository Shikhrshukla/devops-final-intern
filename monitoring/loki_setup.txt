My Goal:
I want to collect all the logs from my different Docker containers in one place. To do this, I used two programs: Loki and Promtail. Loki is like the main database where all the logs are stored. I can access it on port 3100. Promtail is a small helper program â€” its only job is to watch my log files and send everything it finds to Loki.

Setup:
I set it up using docker-compose for both programs and wrote a compose file (docker-compose.yml) that I already pushed to the hub. Then I configured Promtail with a small config file (promtail-config.yml). In this file, I told it two things: where my Loki server is and which log files to watch. I set the path to /var/lib/docker/containers/*/*-json.log to make sure it grabs logs from every container I run.

Step to Run:
I just run the command (docker-compose up -d), Once everything is up, I can pull logs directly from Loki using a curl command: curl "http://localhost:3100/loki/api/v1/query_range?query=%7Bjob%3D%22docker%22%7D&limit=5" Earlier, a simpler query was throwing an error, so I got help from ChatGPT to get the accurate query.

The Simple Workflow:
Promtail watches for new logs. It then sends them to Loki. Loki stores them, and I can search or query them anytime I want.
